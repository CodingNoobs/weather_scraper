# python
A collection of **Python** programs.

This repository has the following general layout:

1) Similiar programs are organized into folders.
2) Each program has its own folder.
3) In each programs' folder should be a **README.md** file which will explain how to get the program in that folder running.
4) In general, for each program, you will need to create a new virtual enviroment on your machine. We do not use Git to keep track of these because each venv is platform specific and there is no need. This is why a **requirements.txt** file is used to install the needed python packages for that program.
5) We use a **.gitignore** file to tell Git that we do not want to track certain folders and files. Such as any folder named **/venv**. 
6) Any questions can be asked here in the [CodingNoobs teams](https://github.com/orgs/CodingNoobs/teams/coding-sqaud) section or in the GroupMe!

## TODO
Create a section talking about how to select the virtual enviroment python interpreter in VS Code.
